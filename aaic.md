## Classifications (KNN)

### What is classification
Classification is a type of supervised learning. Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. 
 An example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”

 Here you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output Y = f(X) . The goal is to [approximate the mapping function](#approximate-function) so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.

In other words Y = f(X) can be represented as

where model is class label, algorithm is [Approximate Function](#approximate-function), data is input 


### Classification & Regression
This is related to regression

#### Approximate Function

It means finding a value nearly equal​ to the actual value of the function at a point or at a set of points.
