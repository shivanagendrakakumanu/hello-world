### What is classification
Classification is a type of supervised learning. Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).

 An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”
